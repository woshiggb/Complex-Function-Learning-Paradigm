# Complex-Function-Learning-Paradigm
For multi-dimensional learning objectives, a new genetic learning method is provided.

### How to Use.
For training with this model, use the following methods:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Test Method:
(Use cmd)
'python file path (.) /CODE/USE1.py'
(The mouse draws a line in a row, so that the model dataset learning method is simulated, and the training is carried out in a single round)
'python (.) /CODE/USE2.py'
(Input/Output, Guess Generalization)
'python (.) /CODE/CODE_LIKE.py'
Compared with the MLP small layer, only the coordinates are used to display the effect at various levels of the model.
(0 - 5) The size of the learning model of the dataset

### Use in Code
'''
import (same path)CODE/code__
model (number, numeric value)
Used to generate a connection for a single dimension
(model.forward(x), model.backward(x,y), train x,y)

modeldwo (the number of receptions of the model (the best fit), [1st layer, 2nd layer, 3rd layer...... -1 layer, last], each layer is a size to indicate how many neurons there are)

models (each)

Train2([number of models (more is better), [number of neurons per layer of the model, number of receptions of the model], of the model], any number)

Train2.forward(x) (vector input)
Train2.backward(y) (vector expectation)
'''
The same goes for models
The same is true for models, but numbers
